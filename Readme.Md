# Smart Home System

The Smart Home System is a simulation that allows users to control different smart devices such as lights, thermostats, and door locks via a central hub. Users can set schedules, automate tasks, and view the status of each device.

## Features

- Initialize the Smart Home System with different devices, each having a unique ID and type (light, thermostat, door lock).
- Turn devices on/off.
- Schedule devices to turn on/off at a specific time.
- Automate tasks based on triggers (e.g., turning off lights when the thermostat reaches a certain temperature).

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the Smart Home System simulation on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- [schedule](https://pypi.org/project/schedule/) library
